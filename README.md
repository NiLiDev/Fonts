# NightLight Fonts Github repository

## The reason for the existence of this repository
NightLight projects may require special fonts for their graphical design. Any font is an intellectual property of its creators. These typographers often don't want their work to become free and worthless. This is the reason why you cannot use NightLight Fonts in your own works or projects.
You might have a question: **why then repository is public?**
**The reason is quite simple: this way of storing assets online is one of the most convenient for us. This still doesn't mean you can use NightLight fonts freely.**

## Current fonts:

### NightLight Sans
- **NightLight Sans is not a free-to-use font.** Only verified NightLight projects can use it.
- You can use NightLight Sans for non-commercial, non-public purposes, when the way you use a font does not go beyond a narrow circle of people.
- These rules apply to all the NightLight Sans family fonts:
 - Thin (100)
 - ExtraLight (200)
 - Light (300)
 - Regular (400)
 - Medium (500)
 - SemiBold (600)
 - ... and their italic versions.
